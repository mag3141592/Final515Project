# ZillowBnb

## Background
Homeowners and potential home buyers often rely on Zillow’s Zestimate to estimate the market price of houses. The Zestimate predicts a home’s value using publicly available housing data and a proprietary machine learning formula. It serves as a starting point for homeowners who are looking to sell their property and enables home buyers to gain a better understanding of the market. Such a feature would be similarly useful to predict the market rental price of a short-term rental unit on Airbnb.  A guest could compare the price of an Airbnb listing to its predicted price to know if they are getting a good deal. A host could easily determine a good price to list their unit.
